Submitted by: **Julia Alfaro**

About this web app: **Used the basic resources, but tried to add girly oriented events there**

Time spent: **5** hours

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

<!-- Make sure to check off completed functionality below -->

- [ x] **The web app uses React to display data from the API**
- [ x] **The web app is connected to a PostgreSQL database, with an appropriately structured Events table**
  - [ x] **NOTE: Your GIF or a screenshot added to this README must include a view of your Railway database that shows the contents of the table used by your app**
- [x ] **The web app displays the title of the app**
- [x ] **A visual interface allows the user to select a Location they would like to view**
- [x ] **Clicking on a Location shows a list of all items from the Events table that corresponds to that Location**
- [ x] **Each Location detail page should have its own unique URL**

The following **optional** features are implemented:
